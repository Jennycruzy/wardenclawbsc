/**
 * Trust Wallet Agent Kit (TWAK) adapter types.
 *
 * TWAK is the SOLE execution layer for WARDENCLAW BSC: local signing, autonomous
 * spot execution, x402 payment, and competition registration. Self-custody is
 * absolute — the private key stays local with TWAK, the backend never signs, and
 * no key is ever stored in a DB. This module models the intents TWAK acts on and
 * the receipts it returns; the real SDK calls live behind the executor interface.
