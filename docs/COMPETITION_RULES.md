# Competition Rules

Transcribed from the official DoraHacks page for *BNB Hack: AI Trading Agent
Edition — CoinMarketCap × Trust Wallet*. Confirmed requirements are separated
from unresolved organizer details. Values used for unresolved items are internal
safety assumptions, not official competition rules. Review and update them when
the organizer publishes exact answers. Run `pnpm verify:competition-rules` to
check this registry.

## Pending organizer clarification

```
rule: Exact disqualification drawdown percentage and measurement basis
source: DoraHacks official page (transcribed 2026-06-09)
status: needs-organizer-confirmation
exact_value: 30% indicative (page example); presumed whole-window peak-to-trough
implementation_file: packages/core/src/config.ts
```

```
rule: Exact simulated-transaction-cost amount/model used in scoring
source: DoraHacks official page (transcribed 2026-06-09); swap fee 0.077%/swap (~0.15% round trip) confirmed by organizer team
status: needs-organizer-confirmation
exact_value: SCORING_SIM_COST_BPS=7.7 per leg, anchored to the confirmed swap fee; exact scoring model still pending
implementation_file: packages/core/src/frictionModel.ts
note: The 0.077% swap fee / 0.15% round trip is the real execution fee (Wallet Ledger,
  twakFeeBps) and is confirmed. Whether scoring simulates exactly that figure is not
  separately confirmed; we model the Scored Ledger with the same number as the best
  grounded estimate.
```

```
rule: Whether WBNB hops / native BNB count as in-scope
source: DoraHacks official page (transcribed 2026-06-09)
status: needs-organizer-confirmation
exact_value: presume not held as a position; WBNB allowed only as a route hop
implementation_file: packages/core/src/eligibleTokens.ts
```

```
rule: The 149-vs-enumerated eligible-token count discrepancy
source: DoraHacks official page (transcribed 2026-06-09)
status: needs-organizer-confirmation
exact_value: enumerated list treated as working truth; SLX duplicated, USDf/USDF both present
implementation_file: data/eligible-tokens.json
```

## Eligible token handling

- Native BNB is **not** on the list (it is not a BEP-20 token). BNB is gas only;
  ranked positions must be held in eligible BEP-20 tokens.
- WBNB is **not** enumerated. It may appear only as an intermediate route hop on
  PancakeSwap, never as a held position.
- The allowlist is keyed by **exact BEP-20 contract address**, never by symbol
  (symbols like B, M, U, H, BRETT, TOSHI, REAL, OPEN have multiple BSC contracts).
- `pnpm build:eligible-tokens` resolves each symbol to its CMC-listed BSC contract
  and writes `data/eligible-tokens.json`. Unresolvable symbols are excluded and
  logged.
